abstract={The persistence diagram of a real-valued function on a topological space is a multiset of points in the extended plane. We prove that under mild assumptions on the function, the persistence diagram is stable:  small changes in the function imply only small changes in the diagram. We apply this result to estimating the homology of sets in a metric space and to comparing and classifying geometric shapes.},

It is shown that ideas latent in the work of two Hungarian mathematicians may be exploited to yield a new method of solving this problem.},
